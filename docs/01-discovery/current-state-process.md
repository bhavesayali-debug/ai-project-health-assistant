# Current-State Project Health Monitoring Process

## 1. Purpose

This document describes how an IT / Software Project Manager currently gathers, analyzes, and communicates project-health information.

The purpose is to understand the existing workflow before designing the AI Project Health Assistant.

---

## 2. When Project Health Is Reviewed

A formal project-health review is typically performed:

- Weekly as part of regular project status reporting
- Before steering committee or leadership meetings
- When a significant risk, issue, milestone delay, or escalation occurs

Although formal reporting may happen weekly, project information continues to change throughout the week.

---

## 3. Project Information Sources

Project-health information may originate from multiple tools and communication channels, including:

- Jira
- Sprint updates
- Confluence
- SharePoint
- ServiceNow
- Project plans and schedules
- Milestone trackers
- Defect trackers
- Risk registers
- Issue registers
- Dependency trackers
- Action-item trackers
- Meeting notes
- Microsoft Teams
- Email / Outlook
- Stakeholder updates

Each source may contain only one part of the overall project picture.

## 4. Current-State Process

### Step 1 — Teams Generate Project Updates

Cross-functional teams continuously generate information about:

- Work completed
- Work in progress
- Delays
- Defects
- Risks
- Issues
- Dependencies
- Milestones
- Decisions
- Action items
- Stakeholder concerns

↓

### Step 2 — Project Manager Collects Information

The PM gathers relevant updates from multiple project systems, documents, meetings, and communication channels.

↓

### Step 3 — PM Reviews and Validates Updates

The PM reviews the available information and determines whether it is:

- Current
- Complete
- Reliable
- Consistent with information from other sources

↓

### Step 4 — PM Correlates Information Across Sources

The PM connects related information from different project sources.

For example:

**Jira**
> API integration is delayed.

**Meeting Notes**
> Vendor access has still not been received.

**Project Plan**
> UAT begins next week.

The PM correlates these updates and recognizes that the upcoming UAT milestone may be at risk.

↓

### Step 5 — PM Identifies Project-Health Concerns

The PM identifies:

- Risks
- Issues
- Blockers
- Dependencies
- Defects
- Schedule concerns
- Milestone impacts
- Scope/change concerns
- Stakeholder concerns

↓

### Step 6 — PM Assesses Overall Project Health

The PM determines whether the project or individual areas are:

- Green — On track
- Amber — Attention required / potential delivery impact
- Red — Significant issue requiring intervention or escalation

↓

### Step 7 — PM Consolidates Project Information

The PM manually consolidates information into a project status report, dashboard, presentation, or other reporting format.

Typical information may include:

- Overall project health
- Milestone status
- Sprint progress
- Risks and issues
- Defect status
- Dependencies
- Key actions
- Decisions required
- Areas requiring management attention

↓

### Step 8 — PM Communicates Project Status

The consolidated project-health information is shared with:

- Project team
- Product Owner
- Business stakeholders
- Sponsors
- Leadership
- Steering committee

↓

### Step 9 — PM Initiates Actions or Escalations

Based on the project-health assessment, the PM may:

- Escalate risks or issues
- Follow up on overdue actions
- Resolve dependencies
- Request decisions
- Re-plan activities
- Coordinate teams
- Raise potential milestone impacts

## 6. Most Time-Consuming Activities

The two activities requiring significant PM effort are:

### Collecting Project Information

Relevant information must be gathered from multiple systems, meetings, documents, and communication channels.

### Consolidating Project Information

The PM must interpret and combine the collected information into a clear project-health report that stakeholders can understand quickly.

These activities are repeated for weekly reporting and before important steering or leadership meetings.

---

## 7. Areas Where Errors May Occur

### Missing a Project Source

A relevant project artifact, discussion, or system may not be reviewed, resulting in an incomplete understanding of project status.

### Stale Information

Formal trackers may contain information that has not yet been updated.

### Overlooked Risks

An emerging concern may be present in meeting notes, emails, or team discussions but may not yet appear in the formal risk register.

### Missed Dependencies

A delay within one workstream may affect another team or milestone without the relationship being immediately obvious.

### Conflicting Information

Different project sources may report different statuses for the same activity.

### Incorrect Interpretation

Information may be available but interpreted without the complete context from other project sources.

---

## 8. Current-State Pain Point

> **A significant amount of Project Manager effort is spent gathering and consolidating project information before the PM can assess overall project health. Because this information is distributed across multiple sources and may be incomplete, stale, or inconsistent, there is also a risk that important delivery signals may be overlooked or interpreted without the full project context.**

---

## 9. Opportunity Identified

The current-state analysis highlights an opportunity to reduce the manual effort involved in gathering, correlating, and consolidating project-health information while helping the PM identify important signals requiring attention.

The exact solution will be defined during the MVP and requirements phase.
